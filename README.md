osx86_linux is a script aimed at people who want to try OS X (hackintosh, but also vanilla pendrive preparation will be possible in the future), but don't have a real MAC to prepare the usb installer, or have a CPU that doesn't support 
virtualization.

This script creates an osx86 installer starting from a dmg file (InstallESD or Install DVD).

Should work with OS X Snow leopard (10.6) and above
 
TODO:
- Clover support (currently not tested/working)
- Vanilla installer support (via boot.efi)
- Some form of dialog / UI
- Cleanup old code
- Test the current code with different images or environments

### Dependencies

Make sure you have source code repositories enabled (deb-src in debian based distributions)

`apt-get install build-essential libbz2-dev libxml2-dev qemu-utils hfsprogs dialog expect-dev`
##### dmg2img
`apt-get build-dep dmg2img`
##### kconfig
`apt-get install gperf libncurses5-dev`

For GTK Configuration support

`apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev libglade2-dev`

For QT Configuration support

`apt-get install libqt4-dev`


![alt kconfig-gconf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smx-smx/osx86_linux/master/doc/gconf.png)


##### darling-dmg
`apt-get install cmake libfuse-dev libssl-dev libicu-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev`

---------------------------

For Virtual HD support:

`apt-get install virtualbox`

For chameleon support:
- chameleon/boot
- chameleon/boot0
- chameleon/boot1h

For additional kexts:
- extra_kexts/FakeSMC.kext
- \<any other kext\> (NullCPUPowerManagement, ps2 controller, ...)

For MBR Patch:
- osinstall_mbr/OSInstall
- osinstall_mbr/OSInstall.mpkg

For Custom SMBios:
- Place smbios.plist in script directory

Note: You will need to run kconfig first to configure the script and create .config. The script won't run otherwise

To do so, run `./bins/bin/kconfig-mconf Kconfig` from the script directory.

If you prefer, you can use kconfig-nconf, konfig-gconf or kconfig-qconf for a different configuration interface.

see ./install_osx.sh -h for usage
